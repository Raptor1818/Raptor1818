## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I'm an 18-year-old student from Italy, with a passion for web and game development.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Godot 4 🤖
- 🛠️ And just finished working on the [second version of my personal website](https://github.com/Raptor1818/raptorino-ts) 🌐

## 🎮 Game Development

In January I participated in my first Game Jam, [PirateSoftware's 14th Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/pirate) with a team of 5 to create [The Grove](https://dano972c.itch.io/the-grove), my first game prototype!
