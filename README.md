## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I'm an 18-year-old student from Italy, currently immersed in the world of game and web development, while balancing my passion for video games.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Godot 4 🤖
- 🔭 And working on a [newer version of my personal website](https://github.com/Raptor1818/raptorino-ts)

## 🎮 Game Development

I have recently participated in my first Game Jam, [PirateSoftware's 14th Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/pirate)!
I worked with a team of 5 to create [The Grove](https://dano972c.itch.io/the-grove) for the game jam.
